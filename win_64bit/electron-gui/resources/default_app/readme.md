# Installing all packages
Please note that, as there is a very high likelihood of us using the Polymer libraries for UI design, any devs working on the UI will need Bower installed on their system(s) globally; this will also require that you have [git](http://www.git-scm.com/) installed on your system, as it is one of Bower's dependencies. The official documentation can be found [here](http://bower.io/), but in short, open your command line and run `npm install -g bower` to install the latest version of Bower to your system (this is also how Bower is updated). Bower is not listed as a dependency in `package.json`, as it will be assumed that it has been globally installed as per the instructions above.

After Bower has been installed, run `bower install` in the `default_app` directory to install all of Bower's dependencies. This will need to be done every time you branch code, as the `bower_components` folder is set to be ignored by git to prevent overloading the repository. Likewise, the `node_modules` folder and log files are also ignored for the same reasons.

For the time being, npm will not be necessary to install any packages, though this may change at any time; if it does, this file will be updated to note that.
